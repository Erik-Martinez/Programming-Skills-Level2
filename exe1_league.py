"""The Big Six of the English Premier League is composed of six teams:
            Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur.
 Develop a system that generates between 0, 1, and 3 points randomly for each team.
 The winner of the Big Six will be the team with the highest accumulated points at the end.
 Each team will play 3 matches against every opponent.
 After the matches, the system will display on-screen the team standings from highest to lowest points.
